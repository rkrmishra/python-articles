## One liner compact code in Python

Some time while working Python code I try to make code concise that helps me to make my line of code reduced.
I found is it easy to navigate code blocks those small in nature. As part of that I will demonstrate few example here.

**Example I -**
  Statement of Work: Find if a number is even.
  Conventional Approach -
  ```
  a = int(input('Enter an integer value: '))
  if a % 2:
    print(a,': is an odd number')
  else:
    print(a,': is an even number')
  ```
  One liner approach replacing multi line if-else -
  ```
  a = int(input('Enter an integer value: '))
  print(a,': is an odd number') if a % 2 else print(a,': is an even number')
  ```
